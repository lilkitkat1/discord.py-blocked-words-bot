# Discord.py Blocked Words Bot
Star the repository if you found it helpful, and fork it if you make any changes that may be useful
Make sure you do NOT share your botToken file (add it to your gitignore)!

This is not the first bot I have made, but it is the first I am releasing publicly. Please do not hesitate to content me if you find anything I missed.

## About the Bot
This bot blocks words that you specify under the blockedWords variable.

## Basics of Python Arrays
When you add words, put them in quotes ("") and add a comma at the end of it only if you are adding another word under it. Do not add a comma if it is the last word in the list (Python doesn't care, but JSON files do care).
